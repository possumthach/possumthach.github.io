    <h3>Skull Lootbox</h3>
    <p>I was helping my mom haul a bunch of shit out of the basement and into the car this afternoon. We are slowly working our way through the towers of cardboard boxes that have been sitting down here for the past eight years, and sometimes we find some cool stuff in between all the baby clothes and Actual Garbage. This time, it was a big cardboard box labeled "SKULLS."</p>
    <p>Apparently the backstory is that before I was even born, my uncle heard my dad had an interest in bones and offered to mail over a bunch of stuff his "<a class="hovernote" title="Up until just now I assumed a trapline was some kind of particular device, but when I looked it up so I could put a picture here for the benefit of everyone who, like me, does not live in rural Montana, it turns out that a trapline is just the route on which traps are set.">buddy with a trapline</a>" had laying around. And then I guess they just sat around for twenty years and nobody told me they were there?!</p>
    <p>Well, now I know, and <a class="hovernote" title="This is a lie. I played Rimworld for two and a half hours first.">as soon as</a> we got back from dumping our refuse at Goodwill I went and got my hands on them. I very excitedly took photographs as I unwrapped them (the skulls were inside plastic bags within the box) one by one. Here we go!</p>
    <center><br><img class="articleImage" src="/images/bones-1.jpg">
    <br><span class="articleCaption">it's like christmas morning in here.</span></center>
    <p>My first pull: a coyote skull and a whole bunch of coyote jaws!</p>
        <center><br><img class="articleImage" src="/images/bones-2.jpg">
        <br><span class="articleCaption">sorry for the blurriness. i <i>did</i> take all these pictures while wearing canvas gloves.</span></center>
    <p>The matching skull tops were in the next bag.</p>
    <center><br><img class="articleImage" src="/images/bones-3.jpg"></center>
    <p>There's a pretty wide range of sizes here. The largest one is probably on par with the larger of my two (alive) dogs -- she is not a huge dog, for sure, but she's too big to fit in the "medium" sized harnesses they sell at Petco, so.</p>
    <center><br><img class="articleImage" src="/images/this-is-not-bones.jpg" width="75%"><br><span class="articleCaption">somehow this is the best picture of her i have on my computer. try and formulate a mental concept of how big of a skull i'm talking about here based on this one image, ok?</span></center>
    <p>The next skull is sadly just the back half of something -- I'm not entirely sure what. My first guess was a large cervid, like an elk or something (spoilers: some other skulls coming up soon are definitely cervids) but the eye sockets don't have that characteristic top ridge. I'll have to give this one a closer look tomorrow when it's light out. The similarity in shape to the coyote skulls make me wonder if this could be a really large domestic dog? It's hard to tell without the jaws.</p>
    <center><br><img class="articleImage" src="/images/bones-4.jpg"></center>
    <p>See, this one is for sure a cervid. I would still call it decently large, but it's much smaller than the previous one. There's some funky stuff going on around the eye sockets and I'm not sure if that's just damage from being left outside in the elements for who knows how long or if it's maybe some kind of pathology.</p>
    <center><br><img class="articleImage" src="/images/bones-5.jpg">
        <br><span class="articleCaption">you expect me to actually know shit about skulls before i write a blog post about them? what do you think this is, national geographic?? i just think bones are cool.</span></center>
    <p>Wedged in the same bag as the cervid is some kind of rodent. I <a class="hovernote" title="That's 'scientific wild-ass guessed,' in case you didn't also have a high school math teacher who thought he was cool.">SWAGged</a> this one as a muskrat based on size, vague knowledge of what animals live in Montana, and the fact that it's definitely not a nutria because I already have a nutria skull and it doesn't look like this.</p>
    <center><br><img class="articleImage" src="/images/bones-6.jpg"><br><span class="articleCaption">the angle of this picture makes it look like the snout is way longer than it actually is.</span></center>
    <p>If you ever wondered what the inside of a coyote tooth looks like, the next pull will answer that question. I'm actually not even disappointed that the teeth are this broken, because it's really cool to see the interior structure. The shiny exterior enamel layer surrounds the softer yellow dentin, and the line down the middle is where the <a class="hovernote" title="I feel like we don't talk enough about how gross it is that the meaty part of the tooth is called the pulp. Eeugh.">pulp</a> once was.</p>
    <center><br><img class="articleImage" src="/images/bones-7.jpg"><br><span class="articleCaption">BONUS ACTIVITY: identify the store this paper bag came from based only on this blurry-ass background shot.</span></center>
    <p>Following this, another coyote skull with broken teeth. This one is easily the worst-for-wear of the coyotes -- its texture is dry and flaky, whereas all the others are smooth to the touch. The big mystery skull and the rodent are also like this.</p>
    <center><br><img class="articleImage" src="/images/bones-8.jpg"></center>
    <p>Last but not least: a smaller cervid, with pedicles! Based on some documentation from <a class="lightLink" href="http://www.jakes-bones.com/2011/02/all-about-deer-pedicles.html">this website<a>, this probably came from a very young deer, just a few months old. I'm sorry that it died, but I think this is a pretty cool thing to own. It might be my favorite out of all of these because it's so unique. You see a lot of full-grown deer and elk skulls in people's houses as a byproduct of hunting, and their commonality makes them inherently less interesting -- even though cervids have really cool skulls, structure-wise, I can't help but get mere-exposure'd into thinking they're not that special. But this one's different! And different is awesome!</p>
    <center><br><img class="articleImage" src="/images/bones-10.jpg"><br><span class="articleCaption">don't mind the blur in the background. we just happen to have giant signs with personally identifiable information on them sitting around. you know how it is.</span></center>
    <p>And that's the final haul.</p>
    <center><br><img class="articleImage" src="/images/bones-11.jpg"></center>
    <p>Plus a bunch of, uh, random bits that were left in the bottom of the bag. I guess if I wanted to glue the coyote teeth back together I could scrounge through this and see if the broken-off pieces are rattling around somewhere?</p>
    <center><br><img class="articleImage" src="/images/bones-9.jpg"><br><span class="articleCaption">yaaaaay...?</span></center>
    <p>I am definitely going to clean these up so they're fit to display upstairs, where people can actually see them instead of just languishing in a box for Ever. I might try peroxide whitening the ones that aren't all porous and gross. I'm not totally sure what to do with the broken coyote jaws -- I could fix them back together with some kind of adhesive and fit the matching skulls on them to make a nicer display, but I also kind of want to use them for something artistic. After all, they're already broken, so I won't have to endure the psychological trauma of Breaking A Perfectly Good Bone For My Own Selfish Reasons just to get some good ol' animal bits.</p>
