    <p>The submersible in this image is based on the <i>Bathysphere</i>, which was constructed in 1929 and operational from 1930 to 1934. There is a very interesting story behind the <i>Bathysphere</i>, its successor the <i>Benthoscope</i>, and the two men principally involved in their creation, which I'd really like to tell in full some other time. For now, all that matters is that the <i>Bathysphere</i> was designed and manufactured by Otis Barton for use by the naturalist William Beebe. Over the course of four years, the two of them made record-breaking deep dives off the coast of Bermuda (their research station was based on the "very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who%27s_on_First%3F">Abbott and Costello</a> type name" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsuch_Island,_Bermuda">Nonsuch Island</a>) to observe various deep sea fishes. Beebe claimed to have seen five new species between 1932 and 1934, which are numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 on the poster above. For the sake of the composition, this fictional submersible is not completely accurate to the real <i>Bathysphere</i>. The real vessel had:
        <br><ul>
            <li>a large rectangular base so it could actually sit flat on the seafloor, whereas I have drawn it tilted at a dramatic angle</li>
            <li>electric and telephone cables that came in at an angle, not from straight above with the hoist</li>
            <li>the searchlight aimed out of the right window, with the center open for observation; the left was initially sealed shut but later refitted with an actual window so they could film through it</li>
        </ul>
    (Again, a full article about the <i>Bathysphere</i> is on the board for a later date.)</p>
    <p>The five species Beebe reported to have seen were <i>only</i> ever seen through the <i>Bathysphere</i>'s windows. They did not capture any specimens; the species were described exclusively from what Beebe saw in situ, which is what the scientific community might call a "bold move". In the 90 years since the <i>Bathysphere</i> dives, no tangible evidence of the "Beebe Five" (no one calls them that) has been found. Nonsuch island was turned into a military base during World War II, which may well have destroyed the marine ecosystem and rendered the Beebe Five extinct, if they ever did actually exist. (<i>Benthoscope</i> dives happened off the coast of California, not the same area as the <i>Bathysphere</i>.) Some are suspected to be misidentifications of other animals, such as the five-lined constellationfish actually being a ctenophore (comb jelly), which has luminescent lines running down its body similar to what Beebe described.</p>

    <p>Besides the Beebe Five, this illustration also features fish from two other deep sea expeditions. The <i>Trieste</i> and <i>Deepstar 4000</i> were Navy vessels built in 1953 and 1965 respectively, and were mobile steerable vessels much more like modern submarines than the <i>Bathysphere</i>. Neither of the cryptids sighted by these vessels were given binomial names, because modern scientists are cowards. The modest "Trieste flatfish" was reported from the bottom of the Challenger Deep, the deepest area of Earth's oceans. The <i>Trieste</i> hit the seafloor at a depth of (approximately, debatedly) 35,800 feet, which is almost ten thousand feet deeper than the deepest-dwelling fish are currently known to venture. Jacques Piccard, witness to the  "Trieste flatfish", claimed it to be a real-deal ray-finned fish, complete with eyeballs, which are not very fashionable in the hadopelagic zone due to a lack of light to use them on. Skeptics say that it was probably really a sea cucumber, which can have eyestalk-like protrusions, but I personally choose to believe in the humble yet intrepid sole that held on to his eyeballs <i>just in case</i> and was finally rewarded by being blasted with a searchlight from a bathyscaphe.</p>
    <p>The "Deepstar 4000 fish", aka "DS4K" (no one calls it that), is a more ominous beast. Sighted a mere ("mere") 4,000 feet underwater off the coast of San Diego, it was claimed to also be a ray-finned fish. DS4K is exceptional for its size, which was apparently much larger than the <i>Deepstar 4000</i> itself, possibly as long as 40 feet. This would make it nearly four times the size of the largest recognized ray-finned fish, the mola, and comparable in size to the second-largest cartilaginous fish, the basking shark. DS4K might have actually been a very large Pacific sleeper shark or related species, which are found up to 6,600 feet deep and grow to potentially 20 feet long (although 14 feet is the highest bound confirmed by scientific standards.) </p>
