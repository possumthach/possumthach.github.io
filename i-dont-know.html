    <h3>THE UNSPELLABLE WORD</h3>
    <p>If you've ever so much as dipped a toe into <a class="hovernote" title="This article is going to assume that you've actually got at least a couple toes in the pool and know what IPA notation is. If you don't, go read up on it or watch some youtube videos or something." >linguistics or conlangs or spelling reforms or whatever,</a> you have probably heard it claimed that "you can spell 'fish' as 'ghoti' while still being completely in line with English orthography!" The rationale there is that you're using the "gh" from "laugh" (pronounced /f/), the "o" from "women" (pronounced /Éª/), and the "ti" from "nation" (pronounced /Êƒ/) -- strung together, these sounds ostensibly make /fÉªÊƒ/. This is a well-known concept and is also pretty easy to pick apart. As is obvious and intuitive to most English speakers, the "gh" digraph never makes the /f/ sound at the start of a syllable, the "ti" in "nation" only makes the /Êƒ/ sound because it's part of the "-tion" (/ÊƒÉ™n/) cluster, and "women" is just a fucked up word that sets no precedents for the rest of the language.

    <br><br>Again: this is not news to anyone. We all know that English spelling rules are inconsistent and there are plenty of words you would never be able to guess the pronunciation of based only on how they're written, nor the spelling based only on how they're said. But even for the gnarliest English words like "phlegm" and "cnidocyte", you could at least approximate them phonetically -- if you were taking quick notes in your marine biology lecture and didn't have time to check how those words were supposed to be spelled, you could write down "flem" and "naidosite" and still get the general idea. But what about a word that you can't even sound out? And a word that you're far more likely to say in casual conversation than "phlegm" or "cnidocyte"? I'm afraid such a word exists, and it is this:</p>

    <p>If you grew up speaking <a class="hovernote" title="I have no idea if this is a thing in other dialects of English, and as you might imagine, it's kind of difficult to research.">American</a> English, you know exactly what this means -- it means "I don't know", of course. But how would you describe the sound of this word? It's not really "letter sounds", it's three <i>notes,</i> made by humming <i>one continuous sound</i> that shifts in pitch from low to high to low again. There's a little bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creaky_voice" class="lightLink">creakiness</a> in there, too. If you make the same "wave" of pitch with your highest, headiest, falsetto-est voice, it doesn't really sound like the same thing, does it?
    <br><br>
    This is the point where the skeptics in the audience are politely raising their hands to say "hey, this isn't a word at all!" Counterpoint: why not? Can you come up with a sensible definition of "word" that includes every other part of spoken English except this one? If so, the field of linguistics would love to hear it. Write a paper. While you're doing that, the rest of us are going to take it as a given that this auditory language unit is in fact a "word" and move on.</p>
    <h3>WHAT IT'S NOT</h3>
    <p>I want to make it clear that the word I'm talking about is <i>not</i> "iunno" or "iono". Those are like, a midpoint on the spectrum from fully-enunciated "I don't know" to this unspellable sound. When you say "iono", you are actually opening your mouth and saying <i>most</i> of the sounds in "I don't know", only dropping the /d/ and /t/, which is the same sort of thing that happens when "going to" becomes "gonna" and "want to" becomes "wanna". These are clearly very spellable words, and they are pronounced with sounds that we recognize in other words: /aÉª/, /n/, /oÊŠ/, /É™/.

    <br><br>The word that is the <a class="hovernote" title="Not in a strictly grammatical case. Hey, that one could be a grammar pun too!">subject of this article</a> is distinct from "iunno", and I'm gonna need you to recognize that in order to move forward with the discussion. Just like axiomatically declaring that it <i>is</i> a word, we have to declare that it <i>is</i> a meaningfully different word than "iunno" or else we're going to be stuck here for years in the quicksand of "trying to come up with solid definitions for linguistic concepts". Stronger and more educated men than I have attempted the journey and perished. Just trust in your heart that this thing 1. is a real word and 2. is possibly synonymous with, but not identical to, "iunno", and we can get on with the interesting stuff.
